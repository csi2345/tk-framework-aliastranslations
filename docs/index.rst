The Alias Translations Framework
######################################

The Alias Translations Framework contains a collection of helpers and tools to make it easy and painless to convert Alias
files to different formats.

.. warning::
    This framework is a wrapper of Alias command lines this is why you must have Alias installed on the computer
    you try to run the code from.

.. note::
    For now, you can only convert files to these formats:
        * .wref
        * .jt
        * .CATPart
        * .igs
        * .stp
